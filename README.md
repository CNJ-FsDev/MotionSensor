# MotionSensor

Welcome! I am going to build a "Motion Sensor" - Working with IOT devices.
Using Python programming to alert its user through its local network, the Raspberry Pi Pico W provides its own IP Address to send & recieve date via MicroPython.

The aim of this project is to alert the user when motion is detected via a local web server as well as logging that data in either a txt or cloud files.
Project will make a buzzer noise when the sensor is tripped. Which will then last for a small duration of time that can be adjusted acordingly.

Hardware:
- 1x Raspberry Pi PICO W
- 1x SunFounder Breadboard Power Bank (Power Supply Module)
- 1x Medium Breadboard
- 1x PIR Sensor (Motion Sensor)
- 1x RGB LED
- 1x Buzzer
- 10x Dupont Line
- 10x Male-Male short line
